# Neural-Networks-From-Scratch

Implemented the following operations: 

forward propagation, cost function, backward propagation, parameter updates, train, predict, affine-forward, affine-backward, activation forward and activation backward in python using just the matrix operation library (numpy). Did not use any other python libraries/modules. (only used Pytorch to load the data)
